# Agent System Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the foundation for implementing a modular agent system in the Roblox-TS template. The system is designed to allow developers to add new functionality without modifying existing code, following SOLID principles and LEAN/YAGNI approaches.

## Important Implementation Rule

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Before implementing any agent system functionality, always request full context and confirmation of requirements. Do not assume scope or begin implementation without explicit approval.**

This rule ensures:
- Clear understanding of requirements
- Appropriate scope of implementation
- Alignment with project goals
- Prevention of over-engineering

## Planned Architecture

### Key Principles
- **SOLID Principles**: Clean, maintainable architecture
- **LEAN/YAGNI**: Minimal viable implementation
- **Modular Design**: Add features without modifying existing code
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Testing First**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Integration Points
- Network communication via existing infrastructure
- GUI integration with HolderApp router
- State management through Reflex
- Permission system for security

## Implementation Guidelines

When the system is ready to be implemented:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core interfaces only
2. **Test Driven**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally
4. **Documentation**: Keep docs updated with implementation
5. **Review Process**: Get approval before expanding scope

## Next Steps

To proceed with implementation:
1. Define specific requirements and scope
2. Get explicit approval for implementation approach
3. Start with minimal viable interfaces
4. Build incrementally with testing
5. Expand based on validated needs

*Remember: Always ask for full context before implementing any functionality.*
